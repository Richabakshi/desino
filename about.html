        'The Heraldry Board is Sweden's highest heraldic authority, regulating only public arms (i.e. national, county and municipal heraldry, and the arms of public offices), whereas the National Heraldry Office also registered personal heraldry (i.e. noble arms and burgher arms). No other northern European country has a comparable heraldic authority, but the College of Arms in Britain and the Court of the Lord Lyon in Scotland are comparable.''
